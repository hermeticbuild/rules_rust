"""Transition to trim per_crate_rustc_flag for non-matching targets.

This module provides a configuration trimming mechanism for the
`experimental_per_crate_rustc_flag` setting. When a target has
`skip_per_crate_rustc_flags = True`, this transition clears the setting,
putting the target back into a canonical configuration.

This is useful for third-party crates (e.g., from crate_universe) that will
never match any per-crate flag filter. Without trimming, these crates would
be rebuilt unnecessarily when any per-crate flag is set, even though the
filter doesn't match them.

Usage:
    Third-party crate generators (like crate_universe) should set
    `skip_per_crate_rustc_flags = True` on generated rust_library targets.
